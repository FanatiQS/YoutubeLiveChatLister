This is a super basic NodeJS script that lists the chat messages from a youtube livestream in the terminal.

First, add your own google api key and make sure that `Youtube Data API v3` is enabled. Details on how to generate a project and api key can be found here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key. Run the script with the url to an active youtube livestream like this: `node index.js url`. The url can be either the full url, or just the video id (the part after the `v=` in the url).

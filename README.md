This is a super basic NodeJS script that lists the chat messages from a youtube livestream in the terminal.

First, add your own google api key and make sure the youtube part is enabled. Run the script with the url to an active youtube livestream like this: `node index.js url`. The url can be either the full url, or just the video id (the part after the `v=` in the url).
